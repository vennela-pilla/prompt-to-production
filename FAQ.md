# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) 💡

## 🛠 Git & GitHub Issues

### When should I open an Issue?
- **Bug Reports:** If you find something broken in the starter code.
- **Clarification:** If the instructions for a User Case (UC) are confusing.
- **Stuck:** If you've been debugging for more than 5 minutes and need help from a tutor (mention them with @username).

### How do I open a good Issue?
1. Click the **Issues** tab -> **New Issue**.
2. Give it a clear title (e.g., \`[UC-0A] Confusion about severity keywords\`).
3. Describe what you're seeing and what you expected.
4. Add a screenshot if it helps!

## 🚀 Creating a Pull Request (PR)

### Step 1: Fork the Repo
Click the **Fork** button at the top right of this page. This creates a copy of the workshop code in your own GitHub account.

### Step 2: Clone Your Fork
Copy your fork's URL and run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/prompt-to-production.git
cd prompt-to-production
```

### Step 3: Create a Branch
**Crucial:** Do not work on the \`main\` branch. Create a new one:
```bash
git checkout -b participant/[your-name]-[city]
# Example: git checkout -b participant/arshdeep-pune
```

### Step 4: Commit & Push
Follow the commit message standard mentioned in the README:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m \"[UC-0A] Fix severity: missing keywords → added triggers\"
git push origin participant/[your-name]-[city]
```

### Step 5: Open the PR
1. Go to the **original** repository (nasscomAI/prompt-to-production).
2. You'll see a yellow bar saying \"Compare & pull request\" — click it!
3. Ensure the **base** is \`nasscomAI/main\` and the **head** is your branch.
4. Fill out the PR template completely.

## 📥 Clone & Download Issues

### ❌ Error: \"Permission Denied (publickey)\"
This happens if you haven't set up SSH keys on GitHub or your local agent isn't running.
- **Quick Fix:** Use the **HTTPS** URL instead of SSH.
- Copy the URL starting with \`https://github.com/...\` from the green **Code** button.
- **SSH Fix:** Run \`ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519\` (or your key name) to ensure your key is active.

### ❌ Error: \"Cloned an empty repository\"
If your folder is empty after cloning:
1. **Check your URL:** Ensure you are cloning your **fork** (e.g., \`github.com/YOUR-NAME/...\`) and not a blank repository you just created.
2. **Check the branch:** Sometimes the default branch is different. Run \`git branch -a\` to see all available branches.
3. **Hidden Files:** On Mac/Linux, run \`ls -la\`. On Windows, enable \"Hidden items\" in File Explorer.

### ❌ Authentication Failed (HTTPS)
If GitHub asks for a password and fails:
- **Personal Access Token (PAT):** Since 2021, GitHub requires a PAT instead of your account password for command-line Git.
- [Generate a PAT here](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with \`repo\` scope.

### ❌ Still can't clone? (Download as ZIP)
If Git is giving you too much trouble:
1. Click the green **Code** button on GitHub.
2. Select **Download ZIP**.
3. Extract the files and then run \`git init\` inside that folder to start your Git journey manually.

## 🤖 AI-Assisted Coding & IDEs

### Which IDE should I use?
We recommend **VS Code** (Visual Studio Code) or **Cursor**.

### Which ones are free for AI coding?
1. **VS Code + Codeium:** VS Code is free, and [Codeium](https://codeium.com/) offers a powerful **Free Forever** tier for individuals.
2. **Cursor:** An AI-native IDE (fork of VS Code) that is built for AI coding. It has a **Free** tier with limited AI requests per month.
3. **VS Code + Tabnine:** [Tabnine](https://www.tabnine.com/) has a free basic tier for code completions.
4. **GitHub Copilot:** While usually a paid service ($10/mo), it is **FREE** for verified students, teachers, and maintainers of popular open-source projects.

### Can I use these in WSL?
Yes! Both VS Code and Cursor work perfectly with WSL. Just run `code .` or `cursor .` from your WSL terminal to open your project.

## 💻 Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

### How do I install WSL?
Open **PowerShell** as Administrator and run:
```powershell
wsl --install
```
Restart your computer after it finishes. By default, this installs Ubuntu.

### ❌ Error: \"Virtualization is not enabled\" (0x80370102)
This means your computer's BIOS has \"Virtualization Technology\" (VT-x or AMD-V) disabled.
- **Fix:** Restart your PC, enter BIOS (usually F2, F10, or Del), find the **Virtualization** setting, and set it to **Enabled**.

### ❌ Error: \"WSL 2 requires an update to its kernel component\" (0x800701bc)
- **Fix:** Download and run the [WSL2 Linux kernel update package](https://aka.ms/wsl2kernel).

### How do I open my files in VS Code?
Inside your WSL terminal, navigate to your project folder and type:
```bash
code .
```
*(Make sure you have the **WSL** extension installed in VS Code for this to work!)*

## 🚧 Common Troubleshooting

### My PR has a red 'X' (Validation Failed)
Check the **Actions** tab. It's likely one of two things:
1. **Commit Message:** Ensure your message follows the exact \`[UC-ID] Fix... → ...\` format.
2. **Python Syntax:** Your script might have a typo. Run it locally first!

### How do I sync my fork with the main repo?
If the workshop leads update the main repo, you can sync yours by clicking **Sync fork** on your GitHub repo page or running:
\`\`\`bash
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
\`\`\`
